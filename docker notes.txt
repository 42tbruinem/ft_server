-i means interactive, we are allowed to interact with the terminal within the container.
RUN accesses the shell of the docker container.
COPY (folder containing files to be copied) (folder to copy these files to)
WORKDIR the starting directory of the container

an image can not contain processes, only 'static' data such as files, therefor we have to start things seperately from constructing.
EXPOSE: expose a port, so the container accepts incoming connections on it
